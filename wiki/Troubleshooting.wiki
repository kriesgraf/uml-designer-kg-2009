Some warning messages appear when you save/copy/open a project in a different/new folder or when you install a new application release. The primary cause is the file 'class-model.dtd'. At each new release installation, original file 'class-model.dtd' in application resources is created and also its file creation date differs from one in your projects' workspace folder.

The DTD version (current is 2.1) is not yet verified. This warning message is sometimes improper but it's better to know now exactly the consequence of copying this file.

In a future release, the DTD version will be verified but the following warning messages will remain.

== can't find File '... ...\class-model.dtd' ==

The project you try to open has been moved from its previous workspace folder or its associated file 'class-model.dtd' has been moved/renamed/deleted by mistake.

if you confirm the question, a new file 'class-model.dtd' will be created in this folder.

== File '... ...\class-model.dtd' is more older than application ressource ==

You have installed a new release and the original file 'class-model.dtd' in application resources is also more recent.

We suggest you to save your current project in a different folder. But if you confirm the question and tick the check box, an original file 'class-model.dtd' will be copied in your project workspace folder.

== File '... ...\class-model.dtd' is more recent than application ressource ==

You have installed or recover an older release and the original file 'class-model.dtd' in application resources is also older.

We suggest you not to confirm question. But if you want do it, an original file 'class-model.dtd' will be copied in your project workspace folder.
