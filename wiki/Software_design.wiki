You can find in SVN repository the http://uml-designer-kg-2009.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Software%20design/ClassXmlProject/UML%20Package%20diagram.PNG 

Sometimes I will use the term <i>namespace</i> instead of package because this term appears in this diagram.

== Package xml ==

The keystones are defined in package <b>xml</b>. For now look at sources in SVN repository
in folder  [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/trunk/?r=13#trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml/], in class declaration, namespace is not yet declared! It's not a mistake, this application is still experimental!

Other classes are declared in this package and assume some interactions with DOM elements.
