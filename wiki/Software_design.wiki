You can find in SVN repository all diagrams presented in this document.

Sometimes I will use the term <i>namespace</i> instead of package because this term appears in this diagram.

== Package xml ==

The keystones are defined in package <b>xml</b>. For now look at sources in SVN repository
in folder  [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/trunk/?r=13#trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml/], in class declaration, namespace is not yet declared! It's not a mistake, this application is still experimental!

Other classes are declared in this package and assume some interactions with DOM elements:
 * XslSimpleTransform encapsulates class XslCompiledTransform to provide new interface methods.
 * XmlReferenceNodeCounter and XmlNodeCounter generate unique ID for XML attributes ID and IDREF.

== Package document ==

As we saw in the introduction, the classes of this package have the same ancestor XmlComponent.

The aim of this package is to provide in interface some business classes which expose only properties and methods. The interface with DOM objets is hidden (protected methods). 

Each class of this package has the burden to build DOM objects: which tag name, which attributes, which children, these impose the structure (DTD) of the XML document.

== Package view ==

As we saw in the introduction, the classes of this package have the same ancestor XmlComponent.

Each class of this package provides an interface between package document and graphical components of package System.Windows.Forms.

=== Class Global View ===

This class has burden to create/update each Xml tag "class" of the UML project data file.

The class dlgClass with its own controls manage the GUI. In this window form, we can find ComboBox, TextBox and DataGridView controls.
