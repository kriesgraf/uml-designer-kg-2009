Sometimes I will use the term _namespace_ instead of package because this is the VB syntax term.

== Package xml ==

The keystones are defined in package *xml*. Look at sources in SVN repository
in folder  [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/#svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml/], in class declaration, namespace is not yet declared! It's not a mistake, this application is still experimental!

Other classes are declared in this package and assume some interactions with DOM elements:
 * *XslSimpleTransform* encapsulates class [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xsl.xslcompiledtransform.aspx XslCompiledTransform] from package System.Xml.Xsl to provide new interface methods.
 * *XmlReferenceNodeCounter* and *XmlNodeCounter* generate unique ID for XML attributes ID and IDREF.

== Package documents ==

As we saw in the introduction, the classes of this package have the same ancestor *XmlComponent*. Look at sources in SVN repository
in folder  [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/#svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/documents svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/documents/]

The aim of this package is to provide in interface some business classes which expose only properties and methods. The interface with DOM objects is hidden (protected methods). 

Each class of this package has the burden to build DOM objects: which tag name, which attributes, which children, these impose the structure (DTD) of the XML document.

== Package bindings ==

As we will often mention these classes in the following class diagrams, it was preferable to present them now. Look at sources in SVN repository
in folder  [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/#svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/bindings svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/bindings/]

 * The class *XmlBindingList* manages a pool of [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.binding.aspx Binding] objects from package System.Windows.Forms. Each one binds a property of a *package view* class with a property of a *Control* object, example: property _Text_ for a [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.textbox.aspx TextBox].

 * The class *XmlBindingDataGridView* manages data bindings between the children of a *XmlComposite* object and a [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.aspx DataGridView]. <br/>It was necessary to design this class to maximize usage of polymorphic calls to set special DataGridView properties, to fill colums and rows (see interface [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml/XmlComponent.vb InterfViewControl]). And also to answer to Windows events: click, delete, add, drag, etc (See interface [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/trunk/ClassXmlProject/bindings/XmlBindingDataGridView.vb InterfGridViewNotifier]).  

 * The class *XmlBindingDataListView* manages data bindings between the children of a *XmlComposite* object and a *DataListView*. The DataListView is not a class from package System.Windows.Forms, we decided to design this class to have the same level of collaboration than a [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.aspx DataGridView].  class. <br/>It was necessary to design *XmlBindingDataListView* to maximize usage of polymorphic calls to set special [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listview.aspx ListView] properties, to draw objects (see interface [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/trunk/ClassXmlProject/xml/XmlComponent.vb InterfViewControl]). And also to answer to Windows events: click, delete, add, drag, etc (See interface [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/trunk/ClassXmlProject/bindings/XmlBindingDataListView.vb InterfListViewNotifier]). <br/>The *XmlBindingDataListView* provides a hierachical view of a UML project, a double mouse click allows to explore sub-levels, a drag & drop move an object to a sub-level. The relation _Stack_ allows to save history and go back from sub-levels and relation _ParentNode_ save current level.

 * The class *XmlBindingCombo* manages only one combo. It was necessary to design this class, similar as a [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.binding.aspx Binding], because [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.combobox.aspx ComboBox] can display a list of data or can be used as a simple input field like a *TextBox*.

 * As against, it was not necessary to specialise class [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listbox.aspx ListBox] because this already owns a _DataSource_ property. For example, we can build an [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.arraylist.aspx ArrayList] of *XmlComponent* objects and use it as DataSource.

== Package view ==

As we saw in the introduction, the classes of this package have the same ancestor *XmlComponent*. Look at sources in SVN repository
in folder  [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/source/browse/#svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/view svn/trunk/ClassXmlProject/view/]

Each class of this package provides an interface between a package documents class and a graphical component class from package System.Windows.Forms. 

=== Class Global View ===

The class *XmlClassGlobalView* has burden to create/update each Xml tag [Software_design_2 class] of the UML project data file.

The class dlgClass with its own controls manage the GUI. In this window form, we can find [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.combobox.aspx ComboBox], [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.textbox.aspx TextBox] and [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.aspx DataGridView] controls.

http://uml-designer-kg-2009.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Software%20design/ClassXmlProject/Class%20global%20view%20diagram%201-2.PNG

=== Class Global View children ===

The Xml tag [Software_design_2 class] node of the UML project data file has several children:

 * Node "collaboration": this references a "relation" node that declares a collaboration between to classes. Project data updates is managed by *XmlClassRelationView* and is parent class *XmlCollaborationSpec*.

 * Node "dependency": this references a "class" node that is in dependency with this class. Project data updates is managed by *XmlClassDependencyView* and is parent class *XmlDependencySpec*.
