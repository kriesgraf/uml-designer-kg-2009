=Installation=

First download the current [http://code.google.com/p/uml-designer-kg-2009/downloads/list release] and save it in a specific folder, for example: {{{C:\Program files\ClassXmlProject}}}. 

When you execute this auto-extractible archive, you will inflate setup application and resources in this folder. Remain it because you would have an error when you will install future releases, see [Troubleshooting troubleshooting]. 

Program {{{setup.exe}}} will install all files, resources and frameworks that are required. If the setup fails to install the *Microsoft .NET 3.5* framework or if you wish to install only the *English* pack, you can download framework [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=97964 here] or [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=90&p=&SrcDisplayLang=en&SrcCategoryId=&SrcFamilyId=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6&u=http%3a%2f%2fdownload.microsoft.com%2fdownload%2f7%2f0%2f3%2f703455ee-a747-4cc8-bd3e-98a615c3aedb%2fdotNetFx35setup.exe there].

= Quick tips =

== Pop-up-menu ==

Most commands can be accessed by right click on the mouse. 

Usually an icon is associated with each menu item to find it faster. Moreover, the objects and commands that can create them have the same icon.

A Menu item unavailable for an object is not yet disable but cause no error.

== Mouse double-click ==

The Edit command is always reachable with a mouse double-click.

== Drag and drop ==

The drag and drop command is available to reorder objects in a list box or data grid views. But this command is not available when the order is unnecessary.

This is available too to move objects down below into a sub-package in list views.
